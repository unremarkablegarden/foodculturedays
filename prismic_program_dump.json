This question is currently at the center of hot debates about the ideologies, laws and technologies that will shape the future of food. Exploring its multiple facets, the panelist will introduce seeds at the intersection of critical developments in seed policy, human rights and innovative food systems. Circulating within a tight framework of laws and regulations and a seed market dominated by the monopoly of a few corporations, seed diversity has been dwindling before our eyes. According to UN estimates, we have lost about 90% of our species and seed diversity in the last fifty to one hundred years – fewer than 200 species make major contributions to food production and only nine plant species account for 66% of total crop production. Linking “The Planetary Wheat Field” to global challenges related to the loss of seed diversity, the panel highlights pathways that promote an understanding of seeds as a commons through innovative food systems and a human rights perspective.",

With this work, the artist reflects on the importance of the kitchen as a domestic place where food is prepared but also where culture is learnt and transmitted almost automatically through the repetition of simple, everyday gestures.

Knowledge is woven through forgetfulness, error, and inaccuracy. Food is an index of this contest between memory and forgetting, an embodied play between what we know, what we want to know, and what we must forget in order to make anew. The consumption of food is a physical, spiritual, and sensual process where the cultural, social, and intellectual are coded in a delicate dance. Sujatro Ghosh’s work ‘Menu of Desire’ revolves around the idea of memory, desire, and eating, taking the fateful Bengal Famine of 1943 as its historical backdrop. Still considered one of the most calamitous human catastrophes of the 20th century – during which more than three million Indians perished due to malnourishment and starvation – it is a brutal reminder of colonial greed and despotism. Sujatro's project, 'Menu of Desire,' will serve two meals, i.e. lunch and dinner, prepared from oral history interviews gathered throughout the course of his research. The project will establish a temporary communal dining area where guests may relax, interact, debate, and rest.",

The alter-ego of Zurich-based performance artist, musician and activist Daniel Hellmann blurs the boundaries between male and female, human and cow, and manages the balancing act between a serious desire to change the world and a humorous sense of lightness.\n\nFor Try Walking in my Hooves, Soya the Cow takes the audience on a philosophical and musical walk through Vevey, allowing the audience to (re)discover the city with a fresh pair of eyes. The focus is deliberately on the presence of non-human bodies: dogs walking their friends; pigeons that have transformed a monument into their toilet; bodies of killed animals that are carried through the streets by humans as food or clothing. In a playful and challenging way, Soya the Cow calls for a new constitution of the relationship between humans and other animals, based on our common animality.",

The narration derives from the meaning of certain indigenous names of mining towns in Minas Gerais. In stories of exploitation and abandonment, decimation of indigenous population and African slavery of colonial times are associated with minerals and food. The narrative takes us to practices in post-mining operations, contrasting with the necessity for land in the same communities, which, in the past, have been sacrificed in favor of the imperial craving for precious minerals. The visuals derive from an informal photographic inventory made by the artist in a “supermarket” for semi-precious stones in Minas Gerais’ capital – Belo Horizonte – and of collections of beans and earth on the university campus of Viçosa, which conducts research for the agricultural industry while serving the mining industry by testing and implementing phytoremediation projects. ",

Her work is invested in notions of radical care, feminist hospitality, and traditions of gathering, and is marked with an investment in the relationship between architecture/space and emotion. Through her work and research, she’s constantly asking and (re)visiting the questions: do we (as women) want to, and why do we have to? as a means of unpacking how domestic practices shape our understanding in cultural, societal and political ways with their ability to preserve and decolonize. Working predominantly through object, intervention and text, her practice is influenced by found and fabricated structures, built environments, and hidden labour. Her work negotiates how these notions play with the tension between reality and possibility, truth and imagination, knowing and not knowing.",
